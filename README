rpg - random palette generator
------------------------------

Generate [almost] completely random palettes for your terminal's colors.

They are almost random in the sense that certain min/max values have been
set to achieve somewhat sane colors.

The min/max values can be changed to your liking - feel free to hack away.


Requirements
------------

In order to run rpg you need shuf (required) and xsetroot (optional).

The first one - shuf - is used to generate random numbers for the RGB values.

The second one - xsetroot - is entirely optional, and is used for setting the
wallpaper color. If xsetroot is not installed, rpg will just ignore it and skip
setting the wallpaper color.


Install
-------

Clone the repo.

    $ cd && git clone https://github.com/fehawen/rpg.git

Run make to install. This will install rpg to ~/bin by default, because that's
the way I like it. Do not run the command as root.

    $ make install

Add ~/.bin to your PATH if not already present.

    export PATH=~/bin:$PATH

Persist colors by adding the following to whichever shellrc you're using.

    rpg reload


Usage
-----

Run rpg without arguments for a list of available commands.
